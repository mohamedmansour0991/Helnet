welcome to HelNet

this application uses vite instead of webpack for a faster code changes

Preferably use yarn instead of npm for a faster installation and better performance

to install the dependencies run the command => yarn or " npm i "

to run the application run the command => yarn dev or " npm run dev "

We will constantly update the Read Me file, so stay tuned :3
